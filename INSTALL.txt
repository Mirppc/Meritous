Building on Windows using MSYS2:

1) https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/INSTALL.txt ctrl+f MSYS2 and follow instructions from here.

However, we need to build in 32-bit, not 64-bit.

So instead of

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

do

pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain

and instead of

export PATH=$PATH:/mingw64/bin

do

export PATH=$PATH:/mingw32/bin

Additionally, based off of https://github.com/mangband/mangband/wiki/MSYS2 with alterations, install the following libraries:

pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL_mixer
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL_image
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libwebp
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libmikmod

2) Navigate to the directory where 'Makefile' is, still in the MSYS2 console, and run

make

If everything goes according to plan, meritous.exe will be compiled from source.

3) meritous.exe requires several dlls to run. You can use the ones provided in the Github respository, or grab them yourself from

C:\msys64\mingw64\bin

(or whever it's installed on your computer).

However, there is one exception. I found that 'libSDL_mixer-1-2-0.dll' that comes with 'mingw-w64-i686-SDL_mixer' does not run .xm files, and therefore can't play the music in Meritous. In this case only, download the compiled executible from the official Meritous website ( http://asceai.net/meritous/ ) and copy over 'SDL_mixer.dll', renaming it to ''libSDL_mixer-1-2-0.dll', and it will start working.
